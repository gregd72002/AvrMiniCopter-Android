REQUIREMENTS
==============
RPi with camera
Android device with PS3 controller
Android (API >= 12)


TODO
==============
- code cleanup
- video storage and management


INSTRUCTIONS
==============
You should be able to use precompiled APK straight onto your Android device (there is no need for root access). The application speaks directly to AVRSPI.

Alternatively, you can compile it yourself. For this there are two options:
- use precompiled gstreamer and rpicamerastreamer libraries
- compile the whole lot yourself

To compile the libraries you will need NDK (android-ndk-r10d) and GStreamer for Android SDK (like 1.4.5 Debug).

To compile the controler only (using pre-compiled libraries) you should be able to add the libraries to your project and do calls straught to them.

Program was compiled using:
- Eclipse version 4.4.1
- SDK: 5.0.1 (Android 21)
- NDK: android-ndk-r10d
- GStreamer: 1.4.5 (DEBUG)

You will need >= Android 12.

Tested using Android 19.

CONTROLS & OPTIONS
===============
- always connect PS3 controller before running this application (otherwise you will need to kill the app and re-run it)
- setup your ESC min and max values in Options
- setup your RPiCopter IP address in Options
- for FPV with glasses set FPV type to 1, otherwise this should be 0
